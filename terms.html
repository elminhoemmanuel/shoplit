                </p>

                <h4>Formation of Contract</h4>
                <p>
                    Both parties agree that browsing the website and gathering information regarding the services provided by the seller does not constitute an offer to sell, but merely an invitation to treat. The parties accept that an offer is only made once you have selected the item you intend to purchase, chosen your preferred payment method, proceeded to the checkout and completed the checkout process.<br>
                    Both parties agree that the acceptance of the offer is not made when the seller contacts you by phone or by email to confirm that the order has been placed online. Your offer is only accepted when we dispatch the product to you and inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered product. Before your order is confirmed, you may be asked to provide additional verifications or information, including but not limited to phone number and address, before we accept the order.<br>
                    Please note that there are cases when an order cannot be processed for various reasons. The Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at any given time.<br>

                <h4>Payment and Pricing</h4>
                <p>
                    We are determined to provide the most accurate pricing information on the Site to our users; however, errors may still occur, such as cases when the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the website. As such, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.<br>
                    We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit card charged. In the event that we are unable to provide the services, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the products.<br>
                    Feel free to check our payments methods <a class="body-links" href="#">here</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our Site accepts the use of voucher codes for orders placed online.

                    Our voucher codes may not be exchanged for cash. With the exception of vouchers issued in accordance with our refunds policy and vouchers issued in exchange for advance payments, we reserve the right to cancel or withdraw our voucher codes at any time.
