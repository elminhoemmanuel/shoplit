                    Services. This information may include Personal Information as well as statistical information

                    When Analytics are, directly or indirectly, associated or combined with Personal Information, such 
                    Analytics will be considered Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

                 version, unique Device identifiers, and mobile network Information, including your mobile phone number).

                 <u>Log Information</u>: We may record or log information from your Devices, their software, and your activity
                  accessing or using our Services. This information may include:<br>

                <p><strong>Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p>
                <p>We use cookies to personalize our Services for you and to collect aggregate information about usage of 
                    our Services. A cookie is a text file or other local storage identifier provided by your browser or 
                    associated applications. We use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your
                     use of our Services. The cookies assign random, unique numbers to your Devices to enable our systems
                      to recognize your Devices and to allow us to see how you use our Services. Additional general 
                      information about cookies and how they work is available at 
                      <a class="website" href="https://allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a><br>
                      The cookies we use in connection with our Services include:<br>
                      <u>Session cookies</u>: Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased 
                      whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant users access to content 
                      and to enable actions they must be logged into their PiggyVest account to perform.<br>
                      <u>Persistent cookies</u>: Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date in the distant future and 
                      remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. We use persistent cookies to 
                      better understand usage patterns so we can improve our Services. For example, we may use a 
                      persistent cookie to associate you with your PiggyVest account or to remember your choices for our
                       Services.<br>
                       <u>Third-party cookies</u>: We permit certain third parties to place cookies through our Services to 
                       provide us with better insights into the use of our Services and user demographics and to 
                       advertise our Services to you. These third parties may collect information about your online 
                       activities over time and across different websites when you access or use our Services. For 
                       example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns for our Services. Google Analytics 
                       generates a cookie to capture information about your use of our Services, which Google uses to 
                       compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services. Google may use a 
                       portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this will not be associated with any other 
                       data held by Google. We may also permit third-party service providers to place cookies for our 
                       Services, as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified 
                       of them and you have consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such third-party cookies
                        or the resulting information, and we are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third
                         parties.<br>
                         By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies on your Devices as 
                         described in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies through our Services, 
                         you may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security 
                         settings of your web browser. Unless you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, our 
                         system may issue cookies when you access or use our Services. If you set your browser settings 
                         to refuse all cookies, the performance of certain features of our Services may be limited or not
                          work at all.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals</strong></p>
                <p>Do Not Track ("<u>DNT</u>") is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences 
                    regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that recognizes 
                    DNT signals from your web browser.</p>
                
                <h3 id="infouse">How We Use Information</h3>
                <p>We may use Analytics as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and for research and commercial

                    authorize it; (2) if the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) if the 
                    information is provided to: (a) comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and 
                    quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas; (b) enforce our Terms of Use or other

                    disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event
                     that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, your Personal Information may be

                       (7) as permitted by applicable law or otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. When you are no 
                       longer our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
                       We may disclose Analytics with third parties as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and for
                        our commercial purposes.
                </p>

                <h3 id="optout">Opt-Out Rights</h3>
                <p>If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can "opt out" by

                <p>We have, and require our third-party service providers that receive Personal Information from us to 
                    have, a comprehensive written information security program that contains administrative, technical, 
                    and physical safeguards for our respective physical facilities and in our respective computer systems,
